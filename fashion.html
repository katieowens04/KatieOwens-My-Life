For my first blog post, I decided to talk about fashion as it is a great passion of mine since i was a little girl. Fashion is more than just clothes; it's a way for us to express ourselves and show off our individuality.
I would say my fashion style is smart casual. I enjoy wearing wide leg jeans, smart trousers and cosy joggers. My fashion idols include, Hailey Bieber, Sophia Tuxford and Whatemwore.

As much as I love the convenience of online shopping, in my opinion there is nothing better than going on a shopping trip, whether its with my mam and sister or my friends I love getting to physically go into shops and try on the clothes while having fun with whoever I'm with. My favourite clothing stores are Zara, Stradivarius and Asos.
