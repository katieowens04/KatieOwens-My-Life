For my first blog post, I decided to talk about fashion as it is a great passion of mine since i was a little girl. Fashion is more than just clothes; it's a way for us to express ourselves and show off our individuality.
I would say my fashion style is smart casual. I enjoy wearing wide leg jeans, smart trousers and cosy joggers. My fashion idols include, Hailey Bieber, Sophia Tuxford and Whatemwore.

As much as I love the convenience of online shopping, in my opinion there is nothing better than going on a shopping trip, whether its with my mam and sister or my friends I love getting to physically go into shops and try on the clothes while having fun with whoever I'm with. My favourite clothing stores are Zara, Stradivarius and Asos.

Sustainable Fashion:
Access to sustainable fashion has never been easier! Brands are taking it more seriously and offering customers environmentally friendly options, Zara now have a page on their website called pre-loved where you can shop second-hand clothing. Another great way to shop sustainably is through charity shops. I enjoy hunting down special items like denim jackets or designer dresses in my local charity stores. 
    </p>
Fashion Trends:
I am someone who finds it impossible to keep up with the latest fashion trends! Each season brings new trends inspiring us to change up our wardrobes. This year bold designs, vibrant colours and sustainable opyions are very popular. Wine and denim are very popular this Winter. If your like me and sometimes get a bit overwhelmed with all of the new trends, It is a good idea to just incorporate one or two items and overtime you will gather some great pieces!
