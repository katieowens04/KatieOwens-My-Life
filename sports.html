        Playing sports is a great way to meet new people, keep active, and improve your mental wellness. There is something for everyone in the world of sports, regardless of whether you prefer team sports, individual activities, or even just watching from the sidelines.

            Growing up I played many different sports including, Gaelic football, camogie, swimming, basketball, Irish dancing and hip-hop dancing. I loved all of these sports but as I grew older and school became more intense, I had to decide which sport I would keep on and so, I chose Gaelic football.

Gaelic football has always been my favourite sport to play and watch . Not only is it a great form of exercise to stay fit and keep active, it is a great way to make friends. I was lucky enough to meet my best friends through Gaelic football when I was younger. Gaelic taught me so much, such as how to deal with heartache after losing games, how to be disciplined and it has also given me my best memories including winning the senior championship final last year! I highly recommend joining your local Gaelic football team and hopefully you will get to experience a lot of success and joy.
